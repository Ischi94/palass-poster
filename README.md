# palass-poster
This is the repo for generating the poster for this years (2020) paleontological association meeting. 

You can render the .Rmd file using `pagedown::chrome_print("poster-mathes.Rmd")`. 

We can link to a html file with further details of the presentation using simple *markdown* syntax and a html previewer by setting *http://htmlpreview.github.io/?* before the link to the github file.
